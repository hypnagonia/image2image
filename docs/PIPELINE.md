# Shikarno — engine and pipeline

Client-side photo development for iPhone ProRAW/DNG and HEIC. Everything runs
in the browser: decoding in WebAssembly, image processing in WebGPU (WGSL),
neural networks in ONNX Runtime Web on the same GPU device. Photographs never
leave the device; models are served from this site and cached locally.

## Modules

| Module | Code | In → out |
|---|---|---|
| Input/Decoder | `src/decode/` (LibRaw 0.22.2 → wasm in `native/libraw`, libheif-js, native `createImageBitmap`) | file bytes → sensor integers + DNG metadata, or display RGB |
| RAW Development | `src/raw/develop.ts`, `develop.wgsl`, `src/color/dng.ts` | sensor data → linear Rec.2020 working texture (strip-wise upload) |
| Neural Restoration | `src/neural/tiles.ts`, `tile_*.wgsl` (SCUNet, NAFNet) | working texture → denoised/restored texture (tiled, only where needed) |
| Image Quality Analysis | `src/analysis/quality.ts` | restored texture → sharpness / noise / detail metrics and the 2× decision |
| Upscaling (optional) | `src/restore/upscale.ts`, `display.ts` (Swin2SR lightweight ×2) | restored texture W×H → working texture 2W×2H (tiled, only when needed) |
| Scene Analysis | `src/analysis/`, `blocks.wgsl`, `stats.wgsl` | textures → `AnalysisReport` (noise profile, blur map, per-region stats, histograms) |
| Semantic Segmentation | `src/neural/scene.ts` (SegFormer-B0 ADE20K → 11 groups) | ~1036 px analysis image, 512 px sliding window (25% overlap, feathered logits) → soft group probabilities at ¼ resolution |
| Depth Estimation | `src/neural/scene.ts` (Depth Anything V2 Small) | global 518 px pass for layout + 4 overlapping full-resolution tiles (least-squares aligned, fine detail only) → relative distance at ~1036 px; depth ramps at person/animal/vehicle outlines snapped to the segmentation outline |
| Mask/Depth Refinement | `src/refine/`, `refine*.wgsl` | network maps → colour-guided-filtered maps at guide resolution + tone base coefficients |
| Automatic Decision Engine | `src/decision/engine.ts` | `AnalysisReport` → `Params` + decision trace |
| Exposure/Tone, Camera Color, Semantic/Depth, DoF, Output | `src/render/renderer.ts`, `render_*.wgsl`, `output.wgsl` | textures + `Params` → display/export texture |
| Look profiles (creative layer) | `src/looks/`, `apply_profile` in `render_tone.wgsl` | technical rendering → graded rendering |
| Output Encoder | `src/output/` | rendered pixels → JPEG / HEIC / 16-bit TIFF / processed linear DNG |
| Orchestration | `src/engine/engine.ts` (Web Worker), `src/main.ts` (UI) | — |

The UI thread only draws the preview and forwards messages; decoding, GPU work
and inference all run in the engine worker.

## Processing order

```
DNG/ProRAW/HEIC → decode (LibRaw / native / libheif)
→ RAW development: black & white level, demosaic (Bayer: Malvar–He–Cutler),
  camera white balance (AsShotNeutral), camera matrix (DNG ColorMatrix/
  ForwardMatrix interpolated by illuminant, AnalogBalance, Bradford → D50 →
  Rec.2020 D65), BaselineExposure, orientation      → linear Rec.2020 (fp16)
→ reduced analysis image (≤768 px, area average)
→ SegFormer-B0, Depth Anything V2 Small (reduced image only)
→ guided-filter refinement against the photograph
→ image statistics (GPU) → decision engine
→ [first preview]
→ SCUNet (tiles with measured visible noise) → NAFNet (tiles measured as blurred)
→ image quality analysis → optional 2× upscale (Swin2SR; the new working image)
→ render: denoise blend → white balance → depth-aware dehaze → exposure
  → local tone mapping → vignette (linear-light exposure falloff)
  → tone curve (display rendering) → user curves
  → technical colour (vibrance/saturation, semantic hue fixes)
  → look profile (tone curve → RGB curves → HSL → saturation response
    → colour balance → 3D LUT → semantic rules → depth curves → intensity blend)
  → sharpening → optional depth of field → film grain → output transform
```

### Deviations from the reference order (and why)

1. **Camera colour matrix before exposure/tone, not after local tone mapping.**
   The matrix is applied during RAW development (§14's own order: calibration →
   white balance → matrix → working space → exposure). Local tone mapping and
   the networks need correct colour to work on.
2. **White-balance refinement after the matrix.** It is applied in working
   space as `A_t · A_0⁻¹`, where `A = M(n)·diag(1/n)` is the full raw→working
   transform for camera neutral `n` (re-solved through the DNG model, including
   the illuminant-dependent matrix). This is algebraically the same as changing
   the camera-space gains and re-developing — without re-developing.
3. **SCUNet/NAFNet run after segmentation, depth and the first preview.** The
   analysis networks see a ≤768 px area-averaged image where sensor noise is
   already averaged away, so denoising first would not change their output but
   would delay the first preview by the full cost of SCUNet on a phone.
   Decisions about denoising use the noise measured on the undenoised image.
4. **Dehaze in linear light before exposure and tone.** The haze model
   `I = J·t + A·(1−t)` holds for scene-linear radiance only.
5. **3D LUT inside the look profile** (creative layer), never as part of the
   technical rendering.
6. **No crop, halation or bloom stages exist** (grain is the last stage,
   after depth of field, as it lies on the film) — the upscale
   stage sits where it would in a film pipeline: after denoise/restoration and
   before everything creative. Because every render stage (tone, look,
   semantic, dehaze, sharpening, depth of field, export) runs per pixel on the
   working image, replacing the working image by its 2× version puts all of
   them at output resolution; masks and depth are sampled in normalised
   coordinates, so they stay aligned.

## Optional 2× upscale

Runs only when the analysis says it helps; otherwise the model is never
downloaded or loaded, and the render path is unchanged (analysis is read-only,
~50 ms for 12 MP: a 4×3 grid of native-resolution 256 px patches).

* **Measurements** (encoded luma, `src/analysis/quality.ts`): Immerkær noise
  σ (lower quartile over patches), noise-corrected Laplacian variance and
  Tenengrad, edge width σ from the Laplacian/gradient energy ratio on edge
  pixels per 32 px block (sharpest quartile — a sharp subject before bokeh is
  not "blurred"), detail density. Unit-tested on synthetic blurred edges
  (0.8/1.6/3 px read back within ~5%).
* **Decision** (deterministic, conservative; target = 12 MP export):
  user-reduced size → skip · severe blur (sharpest quartile ≥ 3 px) → skip ·
  ≥ 16 MP → skip · residual noise above ~2/255 → skip (never upscale noise) ·
  too little real detail → skip · 12–16 MP → only if soft (edge σ ≳ 1.7 px) ·
  8–12 MP → if soft or resolution-limited (detail down to single pixels) ·
  < 8 MP → yes · and never beyond the device budget (2× output ≤ 16 MP on
  phones, 48 MP on desktop). ISO only tightens the noise/detail limits.
* **Colour around the model**: linear × gain → extended Reinhard (white 4) →
  sRGB curve → Swin2SR → exact inverse; highlights near the white keep the
  original data (bilinear). No look is applied before the network.
* **Tiles**: 256 px (fixed graph), 24 px overlap, feathered partition of
  unity in output space; a rolling CPU strip of 512 output rows, flushed to the
  texture as rows complete. Seams measured at 1.02–1.03× the gradient of
  neighbouring rows/columns (i.e. none).
* **Runs in slices** of ~250 ms on the engine's serial queue after the final
  preview, so the photo stays editable; the 2× image replaces the working
  image atomically at the end (restoration is baked into it).
* **Model**: Swin2SR lightweight ×2 (Apache-2.0) converted by
  `scripts/models/swin2sr.py` — fixed 256×256 input, shape logic folded
  (19 113 → 1 955 nodes), shared attention mask stored once in fp16: 15 MB.
  ~1 s per tile on an Apple-silicon desktop GPU (WebGPU EP); phones are
  several times slower. Each new session is self-tested on a probe tile; on
  failure the stage retries on WASM, and if that fails too the photo simply
  continues at 1× ("unavailable" in the Auto tab).
* The decision and metrics are kept on the session (`upscaleApplied`,
  `upscaleFactor`, `upscaleReason`, `qualityMetrics`) and shown as one line in
  the Auto tab.

## Colour

* Working space: linear Rec.2020 D65, scene-referred, fp16 textures.
* Look space: Display P3 with the sRGB transfer curve (what iPhones display).
* Display rendering (`src/render/curves.ts`): a log-logistic tone curve
  applied to luminance as a ratio (no hue shifts), middle grey 0.18 →
  display 0.23, soft toe, highlight shoulder with a path to white; soft gamut
  compression toward luminance instead of per-channel clipping.
* **Exposure is the camera's.** ProRAW carries Apple's metered exposure as
  BaselineExposure; the engine keeps it. The decision engine only *suggests*
  a correction when the subject key leaves a comfortable band (±1 EV max);
  "Auto exposure" in Adjust applies it.

## Decision engine

`src/decision/engine.ts`. Semantic class decides which operations are
appropriate for a region, measurements decide how strong they are, depth
provides spatial context. Every decision is recorded with the numbers it used
(Auto tab, and the "Download analysis JSON" button in Debug).

Examples: denoise strength follows the measured noise σ per luminance bin
(15th percentile of Immerkaer estimates per 32 px block) after the chosen
exposure and shadow lift; restoration runs only on tiles whose estimated blur
σ (noise-corrected Laplacian/gradient ratio, calibrated on Gaussian-blurred
real frames: σ ≈ 0.7 / ratio) exceeds 1.6 px; NAFNet tiles whose output
diverges are rejected by a sanity gate (NAFNet-GoPro is unstable on already
sharp, sharpened content — measured, see `scripts/models/export.py`); dehaze
needs distant regions whose dark channel is raised relative to near ones and
whose local contrast is lower, and is capped so atmosphere never disappears.

### Rendering intent and the local tone anchor

Scene middle grey renders at a fixed display level (`MID_OUT` in
`src/render/curves.ts`) — the camera's exposure decides brightness, not a
per-image target. The curve is calibrated against the phone's own renderings of
the same files: daylight, a dim interior and a night scene land within ≈ 0.2 EV
of them in the mid-tones, while keeping deeper blacks.

Local tone compression pulls the scene toward `local.anchorEV`, which is the
luminance the *subject* is displayed at, not its measured key: an underexposed
frame would otherwise drag its highlights down toward a very dark anchor and
barely lift its shadows (dim, with flat shadows). The anchor may travel at most
≈ 1.2 EV from the key, less in dim scenes and not at all in night scenes — a
night photograph is compressed around its own key, so it stays a night
photograph (measured: median 49 → 15 / 255 on a night ProRAW, the phone's own
rendering 2).

### Apple's mattes in a ProRAW DNG

Every ProRAW file carries the masks the phone computed while shooting, as DNG
1.6 semantic masks (PhotometricInterpretation 52527) in their own SubIFDs:
`semanticskymatte`, `semanticskinmatte`, `portraiteffectsmatte` — JPEG, 8-bit,
half the frame's width and height, named by an Apple URN
(`src/decode/dngMasks.ts`).

* They are decoded with the browser's JPEG decoder (50 ms for 12 MP, 97 ms for
  48 MP) and rotated the same way the working image is.
* `applyAppleMattes` (`src/neural/scene.ts`) folds them into the network's
  probabilities: where a matte claims a pixel more strongly than SegFormer
  did, the other classes give way proportionally, so the probabilities still
  sum to 1; where it says nothing, the network's answer stands.
* Effect measured on the maple landscape: 0.4% of the frame changes class, all
  of it along the sky edge and the thin twigs — exactly where a 512 px sliding
  window cannot see. The subject (portrait) matte is read but not merged: it
  describes depth of field, not a class.
* The skin matte is also uploaded as its own texture and sampled by the look's
  skin protection (`skin_tex` in `render_tone.wgsl`): the look then protects
  exactly the skin the phone found, with the previous estimate (person mask ×
  skin-colour likelihood) kept as a floor for whatever the matte missed.

### HDR HEIC (10-bit base + Apple gain map)

An iPhone HEIC is a 10-bit image plus an auxiliary gain map that says how far
each pixel may rise above display white. The browser's own decoder hands out
neither — it flattens both into 8-bit SDR — so files that carry a gain map go
through libheif's C API instead (`src/decode/heif.ts`; the JS wrapper that
ships with libheif-js only offers 8-bit RGBA).

* Detection is a byte scan for `urn:com:apple:photo:2020:aux:hdrgainmap`, so
  ordinary photographs keep the fast native path and never load libheif.
* The base image is decoded as 16-bit RGBA at its own depth and uploaded as
  `rgba16uint` (entry `main_u16` of `linearize.wgsl`); the gain map, usually
  half size, as `r8unorm`.
* Headroom comes from Apple's MakerNote (tags 33 and 48, `appleHeadroom` in
  `src/decode/exif.ts`); the map is applied in linear light as
  `linear × (1 + (headroom − 1) × gain)`, which is what puts real detail back
  into a window or a sunset instead of a clipped patch.
* Measured on an iPhone 13 sunset frame: decode 0.7–1.2 s for 12 MP, headroom
  2.0× (+1 EV), scene range 9.6 → 10.4 EV, nothing clipped.

### Black point

Whether black renders as black is a property of the *rendering*, not of the
input histogram, so the engine pushes the scene's darkest tones through the
tone curve it is about to use (`src/decision/blacks.ts`): the darkest 0.1% and
1%, plus the ≈ 2 EV × `tone.shadows` the local tone stage lifts them by, read
out as display code values.

* A scene "has black" when its darkest 0.1% sits ≥ 8.5 EV below white (shadow
  material) or the source already clips to black. Haze, fog and open shade do
  not, and are left alone — inventing black there would only destroy them.
* If it has black and the darkest 0.1% still renders above code 5 (milky), the
  black point is deepened just enough to land it near code 2, while the
  darkest 1% must stay at or above code 4 so shadow separation survives.
* The decision trace states the measurement either way ("blacks are solid:
  darkest 0.1% renders at 3/255").

## Look profiles

A profile is JSON (`src/looks/profile.ts`, schema below) plus an optional
`.cube`. It is applied after the technical rendering and never compensates
for camera colour. Intensity 0 is exactly the technical result; blending is
done in OkLab, not in encoded RGB. One profile is active at a time (no
stacking); user adjustments stay in the technical layer.

```

### Spatial refinement (semantic- and depth-aware grading)

The global palette (tone curve → RGB curves → hue shaping → saturation →
palette → colour balance → 3D LUT) is always applied first; the existing
semantic masks and depth map then *refine* it inside the same pass
(`apply_profile` in `render_tone.wgsl`). Nothing new is inferred: the masks
are the SegFormer probabilities after guided-filter refinement and
joint-bilateral upsampling against the pixel (soft 0…1, edge-aware, no
halos), depth is the refined continuous distance. Both are sampled in
normalised image coordinates, so they stay aligned in strip exports and after
the optional 2× upscale (the app has no crop stage). All corrections are
bounded OkLab edits and pass through the profile's intensity blend, so the
palette stays dominant; `spatial` values of 1 are the subtle upper bound.

Priority: **skin → semantic objects → global palette → depth.**

* **Skin**: Apple's skin matte when the file is a ProRAW; otherwise (and as a
  floor) the person mask × a skin-colour likelihood of the technical colour
  (OkLab hue ≈ 25–80°, moderate chroma) — faces and hands rather than
  clothes. Skin keeps ~35% of the palette and ~15% of every local correction;
  a guard then limits its hue departure to ±7°, chroma to +12% and lightness
  to −0.05…+0.04 (no teal/green/magenta skin, no blown skin highlights).
  Depth corrections (the profile's depth curves and the depth refinement)
  never reach skin, so a person farther away is not cooled, darkened or
  desaturated. It supersedes the old per-look "protect" on the person group.
* **Sky**: high chroma compressed above C ≈ 0.09, a small lean on the
  palette's highlight balance (warm palettes warm, teal palettes cool),
  bright skies rolled off (−15% contrast above L ≈ 0.78).
* **Foliage**: strong greens −20% chroma at most; harsh yellow-greens nudged
  ≤ 4° toward film greens.
* **Buildings / roads**: near-neutral surfaces have palette casts pulled back
  halfway to the technical colour (which keeps the real lighting), −8% chroma,
  a hair cooler.
* **Lights**: bright, strongly coloured pixels in the technical render keep
  their hue and chroma through the palette (no semantic class needed).
* **Depth** (continuous, never on skin or sky): foreground +5% contrast and a
  touch warmer (not for cold palettes); background −8% contrast, −12%
  saturation, slightly cooler; far distance ≤ 10% atmospheric haze (lifted
  blacks, lower contrast and colour). Local contrast/texture by depth was
  already part of local tone mapping (near/far multipliers).
* Defaults come from the category (`defaultSpatial`): all off for Neutral,
  subtle for creative looks; profiles saved earlier get them on load.
* Measured on the maple landscape with "Teal & Warm": mean change 2/255, max
  13/255 against the same look without refinement, concentrated in the
  background; the difference map has no mask edges except the real horizon.
* Not applicable here: the app has no halation, bloom or grain stages, and
  the vignette is purely radial, so no optical effect is depth-modulated.

* **Creative colour order.** The 3D LUT is the *base look*: it runs right after
  the profile's tone and RGB curves, and everything after it shapes that
  result — perceptual hue curves → selective colour (8 hue ranges) → opponent
  separation → saturation response and luminance→saturation → palette
  restriction → colour balance. All of it is OkLab, so hue moves never change
  perceived lightness by themselves.
* **Rainbow curves** (hue → hue ±60°, hue → saturation ×0–2, hue → luminance
  ±0.25 L) are periodic cubic curves sampled into a 360-texel table; a second
  row of the same table holds **luminance → saturation** (x = OkLab L, ×0–2),
  the film trait of rich mid-tones with calmer shadows and highlights.
* **Opponent separation** stretches colour along the warm↔cool axis (`axis` =
  the warm pole's OkLab hue) and compresses it across that axis: ±35% / ∓25%
  at amount 1. Unlike palette anchors it does not rotate hues, so teal/orange
  separation grows without colours snapping to a target hue.
* **Palette restriction** (a film's colour script, category "cinema palette"):
  each hue is pulled toward the anchors by a closeness-weighted average of its
  offsets (a hue between two anchors drifts toward both instead of snapping),
  anchor chroma multipliers are blended in the same way, and colours far from
  every anchor are desaturated by `focus`. It runs after the saturation
  response, before colour balance and the 3D LUT.

* Hue ranges use overlapping raised-cosine windows in OkLab hue (no hard
  boundaries); luminance zones use smoothsteps; saturation compression is a
  soft knee; semantic rules are weighted by the refined (guided-filtered,
  joint-bilateral-upsampled) masks; depth parameters are monotone-cubic curves
  over distance, sampled from a 64-texel texture.
* LUTs: `.cube` 17³/33³/65³ parsed in TypeScript, uploaded as rgba16f 3D
  textures, trilinear hardware interpolation, independent strength.
* Previews: every profile is rendered through the same GPU path on a ~300 px
  proxy (15 profiles ≈ 130 ms on an M-series Mac).
* Palette analysis (`src/looks/palette.ts`): OkLab k-means (deterministic),
  hue distribution, zone palettes, warm/cool balance. Informational — never
  applied automatically.
* Reference looks (`src/looks/reference.ts`): *create* derives an editable
  profile from a reference's tone character (brightness-independent), zone
  colour tendencies, saturation distribution, hue ranges and regions. *Match*
  moves the current photo's statistics part of the way toward the reference:
  tone shape around the photo's own median, zone colour differences, chroma
  ratio, per-hue-range and per-region (sky↔sky, vegetation↔vegetation)
  differences. People are excluded from statistics and protected; sky is
  matched only through its own region rule.

## Per-region control

Every region — and **skin**, a layer across people (Apple's skin matte on
ProRAW, else the person mask × a skin-colour likelihood of the
white-balanced source: faces and hands, not clothes) — has the full set of
technical settings and its own tone-range curves (L, R, G, B). Region curves
run after the photo's curves, each weighted by its soft mask; skin's settings
and curves replace the region's by the skin weight. Distance has its own curves too (near / middle / far: soft thirds
of the photo's own depth layers from natural breaks of the refined depth),
applied after the region curves and never on skin. All curves share one
16-row table (photo, 11 regions, skin, 3 distance bands) in a single pass.

**Automatic curves** (`src/decision/autoCurves.ts`): every luminance histogram
(the photo, each region, people as a stand-in for faces, and each distance
band — measured on the refined image) is pushed through exposure, the
local-tone pull and the tone curve, and read as display levels. Small capped
changes fire only outside comfortable ranges: a flat photo gets contrast around
its own median and closed-in whites are opened; a washed-out sky is deepened;
dark faces are lifted (skin curve only); flat vegetation / water / buildings
get a little contrast; a flat foreground gets a little contrast; a landscape's
deep far shadows are lifted a touch. Each fires with a note in the Auto tab.
"Auto curves" in Adjust rescales them (0–150%) without touching curves the
user edited.

The Regions tab exposes the technical per-region parameters the decision
engine sets (exposure, highlights, warmth, tint, saturation, vibrance, hue,
clarity, texture, sharpening, noise reduction, dehaze) for each of the 11
groups. They are blended per pixel by the refined soft masks (guided filter +
joint bilateral upsampling), so there are no region boundaries. The selected
region can be highlighted on the photo.

## iPhone constraints

* SegFormer and Depth Anything never see more than ~1036 px, and only in 512 px / ~0.6-frame
  pieces run one at a time (peak GPU memory of a single small pass). Depth Anything draws
  silhouettes as ramps several pixels wide; the guided filter can move an edge a few pixels
  but not rebuild it, so ramp pixels next to people/animals/vehicles are assigned to their
  side of the segmentation outline (values off the ramp — a hand in front — are kept).
* RAW sources above 16 MP develop at half size on phones ("Working size" in
  Export overrides).
* Sensor data is uploaded strip-wise; the LibRaw heap is dropped right after.
* Full-resolution masks are never stored: guide-resolution maps are
  joint-bilaterally upsampled per pixel at render time.
* SCUNet/NAFNet tiles run only where needed; tile tensors stay on the GPU
  (ONNX Runtime shares the engine's `GPUDevice` through an adapter shim).
* The 2× upscale is limited to a 16 MP result on phones, keeps the crash
  guard armed while it runs (a memory kill leads to "Reopen at half size",
  which never upscales), and holds one 256 px tile plus a 512-row strip.
* Every GPU allocation is tracked; the Debug tab shows time, live and peak GPU
  memory per stage — use it on a real iPhone before adding stages.
* If Safari evicts the tab or the GPU is reset, the photo (kept in the Origin
  Private File System) and all edits are restored automatically.

## Known limitations

* **No CPU/WASM image-processing fallback yet.** Without WebGPU the app says
  so and stops. (Safari on iOS 26 has WebGPU.) ONNX inference itself does fall
  back to WASM SIMD.
* JPEG-XL–compressed DNGs (an iOS option) are not decoded: LibRaw is built
  without libjxl. Lossless-JPEG ProRAW (the compatible default) works; such a
  file is now recognised before LibRaw sees it and reported plainly
  (`tiffCompressions` in `src/decode/exif.ts`, tag 259 = 52546).
* A ProRAW DNG also carries Apple's HDR gain map (named in its XMP); only the
  HEIC path uses it so far.
* HEIC gain maps are used (see below); the base image is still
  display-referred, so white balance and sharpening stay conservative for it.
* Apple's semantic mattes inside a ProRAW file **are** used (see below). Its
  ProfileGainTableMap (tag 52525, 3 MB: a 64×48 spatial grid × 257 tone
  samples) is not: measured on these files it is a local tone map whose gain
  times its input is constant (≈ 0.071), i.e. it flattens the local base to
  mid grey — Apple's own local tone rendering, which the engine already does
  its own way. Its spatial variation is ±1% in the mid-tones and ±10% in deep
  shadows, so adopting it would mean replacing the local tone stage, not
  adding detail.
* SegFormer's weights are licensed for non-commercial use only (see
  `public/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`).
* The processed DNG export is linear, scene-referred and explicitly labelled
  as processed — each raw converter will render it with its own tone curve.
